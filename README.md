# NanoJ-Fluidics: open-source fluid exchange in microscopy

Note: visit the [**Wiki**][10] or [**Forum**][12] for latest updates.

![][8]

NanoJ-Fluidics is an open-source device, composed of easily accessible LEGO-parts, electronics and labware. It is designed to automate and simplify fluid exchange experiments in microscopy. Check the pre-print in bioRxiv: [Automating multimodal microscopy with
NanoJ-Fluidics][11].

## It consists of three parts:
+ [LEGO-based, multiplexable and compact syringe pumps][4]
+ [A simple "hack" to enable liquid exchange on cell culture dishes][5]
+ And a comprehensive [electronic][6] and [software][7] control suite to control the pumps.

This [Wiki][10] provides all the information necessary for researchers to reproduce their own systems and start performing fluidic experiments on their microscopes.

## Developers
NanoJ-Fluidics is developed in a collaboration between the [Henriques][1] and [Leterrier][9] laboratories.
