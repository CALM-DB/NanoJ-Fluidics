# Welcome to the NanoJ-Fluidics package repository!

The NanoJ Open-Source project was created and is maintained by the [Henriques group][1] at the [Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology][2], in [University College London][3].

The Fluidics part of NanoJ enables a simple and direct way for most labs to start performing microfluidic experiments with their microscopes.

## It consists of three parts:
+ [LEGO-based, multiplexable and compact syringe pumps][4]
+ [A simple "hack" to enable liquid exchange on cell culture dishes][5]
+ And a comprehensive [electronic][6] and [software][7] control suite to control the pumps.

This Wiki provides all the information necessary for researchers to reproduce their own systems and start performing fluidic experiments on their microscopes.
